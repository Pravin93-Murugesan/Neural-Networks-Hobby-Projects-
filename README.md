# Neural-Networks-Hobby-Projects-

Neural networks are trained to recognize and classify images. MNIST dataset (handwritten digits as images) is used and the work is done with Keras (an open-source neural-network library written in Python). An example of handwritten digits is shown.

The work includes:
  1. Compiling and training a neural network model / convolutional neural network model
  2. Accuracy and evaluation of a neural network model / convolutional neural network model
